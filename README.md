# Design of AI-driven Business Operation

This project explores the application of AI and data-driven methods to analyze and optimize business operations, with a focus on transportation, demographics, and spatial data in the Netherlands. The repository contains code for data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, as well as Jupyter notebooks for various research topics. The use of heatmaps for various metrics across the country is heavily employed, such as the following example of the number of extra inhabitants willing to cycle to Elementary School if the neighbourhoods with the largest detour factors had them reduced by 20 %:

## Project Structure

- `Topic1/`, `Topic2/`, `Topic3/`  
  Jupyter notebooks for each topic. Together they form the enterity of the analysis performed in this project.
- `codebase/`  
  Core Python package with modules for data loading, calculations, classification, and plotting.
- `data/`  
  Contains raw the datasets small enough to be pushed to git and results generated by the notebook. 
- `graphics/`  
  Output figures and visualizations.
- `neural_net_checkpoints/`  
  Saved model checkpoints.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Design-of-AI-driven-business-operation.git
   cd Design-of-AI-driven-business-operation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data**
   - Since the ODIN and punt_tot_punt data was shared with us through the TUe canvas page, we cannot provide a script that downloads, unzips and places the files in the right place. Instead you will simply have to make sure that the files are placed in the datafolder. In addition you will need the following file: https://geodata.cbs.nl/files/Wijkenbuurtkaart/WijkBuurtkaart_2023_v2.zip and the "buurt_to_PC_mapping.csv"

## Usage

### Running Notebooks

Open any notebook in `Topic1/`, `Topic2/`, or `Topic3/` using JupyterLab or VS Code. Each notebook is self-contained and demonstrates a specific analysis or experiment.

### Using the Codebase

You can import and use the core functions in your own scripts or notebooks. For example:

```python
from codebase import load_demograhics, load_buurt_data, plot_confusion_matrix
```

See [codebase/__init__.py](codebase/__init__.py) for available imports.

## Main Features

- **Data Loading:** Utilities for loading demographic, spatial, and transportation datasets.
- **Preprocessing:** Filtering, cleaning, and mapping of data (e.g., postcode to neighborhood).
- **Analysis:** Functions for calculating willingness to cycle, detour factors, and classification models.
- **Visualization:** Plotting functions for heatmaps, confusion matrices, and spatial data.
